# SureShot: Digital Immunization Records & Coordinated Health Drives
India’s vaccination system still faces huge challenges due to paper-based records, which can easily get lost or damaged. This leads to missed vaccine doses, incomplete histories, and inefficient public health drives. Our team built a comprehensive digital solution that empowers parents, doctors, and healthcare workers—making immunization tracking seamless, timely, and transparent.

# What we built:
- Digital Vaccination Card: Every child is registered by a doctor at birth or first visit, and their vaccination card is securely digitized. The card shows a clear vaccination schedule and automatically logs every administered dose.
- Automated Reminders: Parents receive timely reminders via email and SMS—30, 15, 7, and 1 day before each scheduled vaccination. This helps ensure no dose is forgotten and improves overall coverage.
- Vaccination History & Doctor Access: Both parents and doctors have access to a child’s up-to-date vaccination history. This enables any doctor to quickly review and update records, improving continuity of care.
- QR-based Vaccine Confirmation: After each vaccination, parents present a unique QR code for the pending dose. The doctor scans it to confirm administration, instantly updating the record and sending confirmation via email and SMS to the parent.
- Vaccination Drive Notifications: When a government vaccination drive is launched in a city, all eligible families receive automatic email and SMS alerts, including drive details. Healthcare workers assigned to the drive can view all required details and use the same QR-based system to confirm and log each administered dose.

# Tech Stack we used:
- Next.js for the frontend
- FastAPI for the backend
- Supabase for auth, database and storage
